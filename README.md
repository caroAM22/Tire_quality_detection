# Tire Quality Detection through Computer Vision

## Project Description

This project, focused on tire quality detection, employs computer vision techniques implemented primarily in Python with the OpenCV library. The goal is to develop a system capable of identifying defective tires from a dataset containing classified images as either defective or good.

## Dataset

The program utilizes the "Tyre Quality Classification" dataset obtained from Kaggle, consisting of 1854 digital images in jpg format. These images are labeled as defective (1028) and good (828), facilitating the development of an efficient tire inspection system for production.

## Objectives

**General Objective:**
Improve the quality control process in the tire industry and reduce the chances of accidents due to defective tires.

**Specific Objectives:**
1. Perform preprocessing of tire images from the dataset.
2. Develop a classifier for defective and good tires.
3. Document the developed code, analyses performed, and conclusions.

## Execution Instructions

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/tire-project.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the program: `Computer_Vision_Project.ipynb`
